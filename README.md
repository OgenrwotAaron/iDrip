# iDrip
IV drip Solution duration estimator using computer vision

# How it works
This app uses Computer Vision to estimate the time it takes for the drip solution in a IV Solution bag to be drained by counting number of drips in a specified time

# Why the App
In most African Public Medical facilities the ratio of medical-personel:patient is about 1:500 which results in poor monitoring of these patients' medication by the medical personel.
This app helps in monitoring IV drip flow and notifying a medical personel when the Solution has been drained
